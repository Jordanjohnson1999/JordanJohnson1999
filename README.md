## Self-taught coder focused on cybersecurity
Learning by breaking, building, and fixing.
Currently working in Python and Linux while balancing a full-time construction career.

- Building a strong foundation in ethical hacking and Red Team tooling
- Practicing Bash scripting, automation, and tool development
- Studying for the eJPT certification
- Logging progress through TryHackMe and LeetCode
- Documenting my journey and sharing my tools in public repos
- Inspired by curiosity, driven by purpose

## Tools & Technologies I Use
Python - Bash - Linux - Git - VS Code - Terminal
TryHackMe - LeetCode - Multipass - UTM - SSH

---

## Backround & Work Ethic
By day, I work full-time in construction, often on long 10-day rotations.
By night, Even after long shifts, I dedicate 1-2 hours each night to coding, cybersecurity, and tool building.
My path isn't traditional - but my persistence, disipline, and curiosity push me forward every single day.
I'm building toward a future in cybersecurity, one tool and lesson at a time.

---

## Current Learning Focus
- Python scripting for cybersecurity
- Offensive security tools (scanning, harvesting, enumeration)
- TryHackMe Red Team Labs
- Studying toward eJPT
- Terminal mastery and real-world problem solving

## Projects I'm Building
I'm actively building small but growing tools that simulate real Red Team workflows:

-  **Credential Harvester** - Captures username/password input with CLI simulation
-  **Port Scanners** - Multi-threaded Python tool for host scanning
-  **Flashcards CLI App** - Study aid with scores, streaks, and topics
-  **Habit Tracker** - Terminal-based tracker (with Rich/Textual visual output)
-  **Red Team Ping Sweeper** - TCB-based sweeper built for stealthy network mapping
-  **Mind Mapper** - Journal CLI tool with keyword tagging and visual output

Checkout my repos to see them in action.

## TryHackMe Progress
I've completed **43+ TryHackMe rooms**, focused on building strong fundamentals for entry-level security and SOC roles.

**Primary focus areas:**
- SOC workflows, alert triage, and log analysis (Splunk, Elastic, SEIM)
- Networking fundamentals (OSI model, DNS, HTTP, packets, LANs)
- Linux and Window system fundamentals
- Threat intelligence and defensive security frameworks

**Notable rooms completed:**
- Splunk: The Basics
- Intorduction to SEIM
- Alert Triage with Elastic
- ItsyBitsy (ELK-based incident investigation)
- Juniour Security Analyst Intro
- Defensive Security Intro
- Linux Fundamentals (part 1-3)
- Windows Fundamentals (1-3)
- OSI Models, DNS in Detail, HTTP in Detail
- Pyramid of Pain, Diamond Model, Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE

I prioritize deep understanding of core concepts over rushing advanced content, with the goal of analyzing alerts, understanding systems behaviour, and building my own security-focused tools.



Each of these labs helped reinforce the basics i need to build my own tools from scripts. Rather than rush through advanced rooms, I'm using every lab as a launchpad for deeper hands-on learning.
