## Self-taught coder focused on cybersecurity
Learning by breaking, building, and fixing.
Currently working in Python and Linux while balancing a full-time construction career.

- Building a strong foundation in ethical hacking and Red Team tooling
- Practicing Bash scripting, automation, and tool development
- Studying for the eJPT certification
- Logging progress through TryHackMe and LeetCode
- Documenting my journey and sharing my tools in public repos
- Inspired by curiosity, driven by purpose

## Tools & Technologies I Use
Python - Bash - Linux - Git - VS Code - Terminal
TryHackMe - LeetCode - Multipass - UTM - SSH

---

## Backround & Work Ethic
By day, I work full-time in construction, often on long 10-day rotations.
By night, Even after long shifts, I dedicate 1-2 hours each night to coding, cybersecurity, and tool building.
My path isn't traditional - but my persistence, disipline, and curiosity push me forward every single day.
I'm building toward a future in cybersecurity, one tool and lesson at a time.

---

## Current Learning Focus
- Python scripting for cybersecurity
- Offensive security tools (scanning, harvesting, enumeration)
- TryHackMe Red Team Labs
- Studying toward eJPT
- Terminal mastery and real-world problem solving

---

## Projects I'm Building
I'm actively building small but growing tools that simulate real Red Team workflows:

-  **Credential Harvester** - Captures username/password input with CLI simulation
-  **Port Scanners** - Multi-threaded Python tool for host scanning
-  **Flashcards CLI App** - Study aid with scores, streaks, and topics
-  **Habit Tracker** - Terminal-based tracker (with Rich/Textual visual output)
-  **Red Team Ping Sweeper** - TCB-based sweeper built for stealthy network mapping
-  **Mind Mapper** - Journal CLI tool with keyword tagging and visual output

Checkout my repos to see them in action.

## TryHackMe Progress
I've completed 14 beginner-level rooms so far, focusing on Linux, networking, and foundational Red Team concepts.

Notable rooms completed:
- Linux Fundamentals (Part 1 & 2)
- Offensive Security Intro
- Frames and Packets
- OSI Models
- DNS in Detail
- HTTP in Detail
- Defensive Security Intro

Each of these labs helped reinforce the basics i need to build my own tools from scripts. Rather than rush through advanced rooms, I'm using every lab as a launchpad for deeper hands-on learning.
